# Leet-Code-Problems


In this repo are a bunch of numbered folders. Each folder represents a question that can be found on leetCode.com. LeetCode problems are numbered and the number in each folder corresponds to the problem on leetcode with that number. Each folder has a README describing the problem and a few solutions to the problem in different coding languages. Files always include a test suite and some files include multiple solutions to the same problem.

organize.py is a python file used to organize the files and keep everything uniform.

initialize.py is a python file used to create a directory with the files needed to do a new problem. These files include a main.js file (initialized with a test suite), a main.py file (also initialized with a test suite), and a README.md file where I put the prompt for reference.
